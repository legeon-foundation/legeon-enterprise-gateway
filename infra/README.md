# Infrastructure

This folder will contain deployment, environment, and operational configuration for the Enterprise Gateway.

Planned components:

- Environment configuration (`env.example`, secrets references, etc.)
- Docker / containerization scaffolding
- CI/CD workflow definitions
- Infrastructure-as-code (IaC) for future deployment

No production secrets or sensitive information will be stored in this directory.
